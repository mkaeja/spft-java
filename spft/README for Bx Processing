Bx processing in python must be completed in a custom environment to ensure all the nessesary packages/ versions are present.

To create a custom environment with the correct packages, when logged in on the server please
1. ENTER: conda create -n SPFT python=3.9 jupyterlab=3.6.3 scipy numpy pandas matplotlib
2. ENTER: conda activate SPFT
3. ENTER: conda install -c conda-forge tslearn=0.6.2

Once your custom environment is installed you must enter the environment in a very specific way for the packages to load correctly in python.
1. Make sure you're in the base environment, if not ENTER: conda deactivate
2. ENTER: module load anaconda3
3. ENTER: conda activate SPFT
4. ENTER: jupyter lab

Then port forward as normal to your jupyter notebook.
